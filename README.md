X-AVR
=====

**X-AVR** is an Xcode template for generating `AVR C` projects.

Now the meta version: **X-AVR** is a python script which uses the installed `avr-gcc` and `avrdude` to generate and install an Xcode `TemplateInfo.plist` file. This template can be used to create `AVR C` Xcode projects with a `Makefile` to build and upload the program to an `AVR` chip.

*Notice*: This template does not generate projects in *the arduino language*. The generated project uses the `C` language and the `avr-libc` library.

For example, activating pin 13 on an arduino looks like this:

```C
DDRB |= _BV(PB5)
PORTB |= _BV(PB5)
```

and not:

```C
pinMode(13, OUTPUT)
digitalWrite(13, HIGH)
```

# Motivation

There are literally dozens of articles and blog posts showing a very basic setup to use Xcode for `AVR` C programming: a C project with an external build system based on a `Makefile`.

The problem is that with such a basic setup you might as well use a simple text editor instead of Xcode.
Indeed, you don't get much besides a rudimentary syntax coloring (no autocomplete for example).

To fix this, the `X-AVR` project template setus up a *fake* build target (called `index`) which uses clang to enable Xcode to parse and index your project code.
`X-AVR` also cnfigures the following variables for your build:
* `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS`: So that Xcode can index the `avr-libc` headers and include their definitions (port and register names, functions, etc.) in the autocomplete suggestions
* `GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS`: The selected MCU macro is set (e.g. `__AVR_ATmega328__`) to get accurate autocomplete over the port and register names. `F_CPU` macro is also set (otherwise the indexing would encouter errors)

Also, `X-AVR`, and unlike many other `Makefile`s and templates, automatically picks up all the `.c` and `.h` files in your project.

# Usage

Clone this repository or download the source zip somewhere in your mac and run `python setup.py` to generate and install the Xcode project template.

The previous step need only be run once (or whenever you install a new `avr-gcc` version).

Once the template is installed, you should see an `xavr` entry in the new project wizard in Xcode.

The wizard page lets you select the target MCU, its frequency and the programmer to be used to upload the program.

After the wizard is done, hit `Cmd+B` to build the project.

The project is created with the following targets:

* `All`: performs a clean build and uploads the generated hex to the target MCU
* `Build`: performs a clean build
* `Upload`: uploads the generated hex to the target MCU
* `Clean`: deletes the build artifcats
* `Index`: a *trick* target to get Xcode autocompletion to work. You're not supposed to interact with this target

# Prequisites

* `avr-gcc` must be installed and in the `PATH` variable (detectable via a `which avr-gcc`)
* `avrdude` must be installed and in the `PATH` variable (detectable via a `which avrdude`)

Simply install [AVR Crosspack](http://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/index.html) to satisfy these prequisites.

Another option is to use `homebrew`:

```
brew install avrdude
brew tap larsimmisch/avr
brew install avr-libc
```
